Hi! I'm Andrew, a second-year at Case Western Reserve University studying computer science and mathematics. I grew up in Seattle, WA and Hong Kong. My interests lie in artificial intelligence, algorithms, and finance. As such, I am currently involved in several research projects that lie at the heart of their intersections (see [publications](/publications)). In my free time, I like to solve puzzles, play piano (current favorite: Liszt), and be with my [dog](assets/images/son.jpg). I also like to write down things of interest -- or of no interest -- in my [blog](/blog).

With the support of professors <a class="about-link" href="https://engineering.case.edu/about/school-directory/shuai-xu" target="_blank">Shuai Xu</a> and <a href="https://engineering.case.edu/about/school-directory/vipin-chaudhary" target="_blank">Vipin Chaudhary</a>, I founded and currently lead **quant[at]CWRU**, a research group of undergraduates and post-grads focused on integrating current paradigms in machine learning to solve hard financial tasks. I also work with: 
- Professor <a href="https://ottovonxu.github.io/" target="_blank">Zhaozhuo Xu</a> (on faithfulness in large language models)
- Reseachers at <a href="https://aiml.rice.edu/" target="_blank">Rice AI</a> and <a href="https://imes.mit.edu/" target="_blank">MIT</a> (on network pruning and editing)
- <a href="https://gammatau.ai/" target="_blank">GammaTau</a> (on mechanistic interpretability and more language model stuff) -- an undergraduate research group started by my friends <a href="https://noahshinn.com/" target="_blank">Noah Shinn</a> and <a href="https://federico.codes/#" target="_blank">Federico Cassano</a>.

Broadly, some questions in AI that I am interested in addressing include:
- How can we ensure that the systems we build are faithful and secure?
- Models improve with size, yet they are often overparametrized and inefficient. How do we effectively balance this scale-bloat tradeoff?
- How do neural networks fundamentally reason, think, and *learn*?
- On that topic, where do we draw the line for artificial general intelligence as it grows nearer?

Previously, I worked with <a class="about-link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/angelalban/" target="_blank">Angel Alban</a> to create better healthcare systems as an intern for <a class="about-link" href="https://www.zventus.com/" target="_blank">Zventus</a>.
