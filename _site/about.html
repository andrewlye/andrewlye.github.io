<p>Hi! I’m Andrew, an undergraduate at Case Western Reserve University studying computer science and mathematics. I’m grew up in Seattle, WA and Hong Kong. My interests lie in artificial intelligence, algorithms, and finance. As such, I am currently involved in several research projects which lie at the heart of these interests (see publications). In my free time, I like to solve puzzles, play piano (current favorite: Liszt), and code. I also like to write down anything of interest – or of no interest – in my blog.</p>
