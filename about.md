Hi! I'm Andrew, a second-year at Case Western Reserve University studying computer science and mathematics. I grew up in Seattle, WA and Hong Kong. My interests lie in artificial intelligence, algorithms, and finance. As such, I am currently involved in several research projects which lie at the heart of these interests (see [publications](/publications)). In my free time, I like to solve puzzles, play piano (current favorite: Liszt), and code. I also like to write down anything of interest -- or of no interest -- in my [blog](/blog).
