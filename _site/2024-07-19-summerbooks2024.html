<p><strong>Deep Learning: Foundations and Concepts</strong> <br />
<em>Christopher M. Bishop and Hugh Bishop</em> <br />
üê¢</p>

<p>An in-depth introduction to the various pivotal concepts, algorithms, and architectures behind the modern deep learning revolution. Quite mathematically notation dense which admittedly made some sections difficult to read, but I generally found myself leaving each chapter satisfied. Likely due to the large scope of the book, some areas are rigorously reviewed while others I felt could be expanded upon more. In particular, some topics I would have liked to have seen included more were universal approximation theorems, state space models, and deep reinforcement learning. Overall an educational textbook that I would highly recommend for learning the fundamental technical aspects behind deep learning.</p>

<strong>How to Solve It</strong> <br />
<em>George P√≥lya</em> <br />
üéØ</p>

<p><em>Can you see it at a glance?</em> A mathematically-inclined study into the practice of heuristic (or as the book terms it, ‚Äúplausible‚Äù) reasoning for general problem solving. Well-written with clear example figures, the book adopts a sort of nonlinear structure with references to succeeding sections and material ‚Äì although it is still best read front to back. The majority of content revolves around the <em>Dictionary</em>, which contains short musings on various skills, stories, and topics related to solving problems. Some personal favorites of mine were: Determination, hope, success; Generalization; Heuristic/Heuristic reasoning; Modern heuristic; Pappus; The future mathematician; and Working backwards.</p>

<strong>Fractals: On the Edge of Chaos</strong> <br />
<em>Oliver Linton</em> <br />
ü´ß</p>

<p>An informative and well-diagrammed overview of fractal systems and some of the math behind them. The author‚Äôs passion for the subject is clear throughout the book, and I spent a lot of time admiring the book‚Äôs many illustrations of fractal geometry.</p>
