Hi! I’m Andrew, a second-year at Case Western Reserve University studying computer science and mathematics. I grew up in Seattle, WA and Hong Kong. My interests lie in artificial intelligence, algorithms, and finance. As such, I am currently involved in several research projects that lie at the heart of their intersections (see <a href="/publications">publications</a>). In my free time, I like to solve puzzles, play piano (current favorite: Liszt), and be with my <a href="/assets/images/son.jpg">dog</a>. I also like to write down things of interest – or of no interest – in my <a href="/blog">blog</a>.</p>

<p>With the support of <a class="about-link" href="https://engineering.case.edu/about/school-directory/shuai-xu" target="_blank">Shuai Xu</a> and <a href="https://engineering.case.edu/about/school-directory/vipin-chaudhary" target="_blank">Vipin Chaudhary</a>, I founded and currently lead <strong>quant[at]CWRU</strong>, a research group of undergraduates and post-grads focused on integrating current paradigms in machine learning to solve hard financial tasks. I also work with:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Professor <a href="https://ottovonxu.github.io/" target="_blank">Zhaozhuo Xu</a> (on faithfulness in large language models)</li>
  <li>Reseachers at <a href="https://aiml.rice.edu/" target="_blank">Rice AI</a> and <a href="https://imes.mit.edu/" target="_blank">MIT</a> (on network pruning and editing)</li>
  <li><a href="https://gammatau.ai/" target="_blank">GammaTau</a> (on mechanistic interpretability and more language model stuff) – an undergraduate research group started by my friends <a href="https://noahshinn.com/" target="_blank">Noah Shinn</a> and <a href="https://federico.codes/#" target="_blank">Federico Cassano</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Broadly, some questions in AI I am interested in addressing include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How can we ensure that the systems we build are faithful and secure?</li>
  <li>Models improve with size, yet they are often overparametrized and inefficient. How do we effectively balance this scale-bloat tradeoff?</li>
  <li>How do neural networks fundamentally reason, think, and <em>learn</em>?</li>
  <li>On that topic, where do we draw the line for artificial general intelligence as it grows nearer?</li>
</ul>

<p>Previously, I worked with <a class="about-link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/angelalban/" target="_blank">Angel Alban</a> to create better healthcare systems as an intern for <a class="about-link" href="https://www.zventus.com/" target="_blank">Zventus</a>.</p>
