<p><strong>Deep Learning: Foundations and Concepts</strong> <br />
<em>Christopher M. Bishop and Hugh Bishop</em> <br />
üê¢</p>

<p>An in-depth introduction to the various pivotal concepts, algorithms, and architectures behind the modern deep learning revolution. Quite mathematically notation dense which admittedly made some sections difficult to read, but I generally found myself leaving each chapter satisfied. Likely due to the large scope of the book, some areas are rigorously reviewed while others I felt could be expanded upon more. In particular, some topics I would have liked to have seen included more were universal approximation theorems, state space models, and deep reinforcement learning. Overall an educational textbook that I would highly recommend for learning the fundamental technical aspects behind deep learning.</p>
